bun run build && bun run preview  

bun run preview (or npm run preview): Serves the built (production) 
version of your app, so you see exactly what will be deployed.


npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev








In Netlify, go to your site’s
 "Site settings" → "Build & deploy" → 
 "Continuous Deployment". If GitHub is connected,
  you’ll see the repo details and branch 
listed there. If not, it will say manual 
deploy or prompt you to connect a Git provider.
